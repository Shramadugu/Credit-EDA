Case Study: EDA in Risk Analytics for Consumer Loans
Introduction:
This case study explores the use of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to minimize financial risk in consumer lending. It focuses on identifying patterns that indicate a clientâ€™s likelihood of default.

Business Understanding:
Loan providers often struggle with applicants who lack sufficient credit histories, leading to potential defaults. Your goal is to analyze data to ensure that creditworthy applicants are not unjustly rejected.

Decision Risks:
Opportunity Loss: Rejecting a creditworthy applicant results in lost business.
Financial Loss: Approving loans for high-risk applicants can lead to defaults.
Loan Application Outcomes
Approved: Loan granted.
Cancelled: Client withdraws application.
Refused: Loan denied due to unmet criteria.
Unused Offer: Loan canceled at various stages.
Business Objectives:
*Identify patterns indicating default risk.
*Inform decisions on loan approvals, amounts, and interest rates.
*Ensure deserving applicants are not rejected.
